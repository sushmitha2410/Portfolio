            <p">
            I love UI/UX designing, Frontend

					<h4>A little about me</h4>
            <p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science Engineer from Jain (Deemed-to-be) University. With a strong passion for UI/UX design and a keen interest in Frontend Development, I have honed my skills by working on projects that utilize modern web technologies like HTML, CSS (with TailwindCSS), Next.js, React, and TypeScript/JavaScript. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve developed an eye for clean design and efficient coding practices, making me adept at creating seamless and visually appealing user interfaces.
              <br>
              Outside of the tech world, I have a creative and curious side. Iâ€™m passionate about baking and cooking, finding joy in experimenting with flavors and creating something delightful. A bookworm at heart, I love immersing myself in fictional worlds, and my interest in psychology keeps me exploring how the human mind worksâ€”a pursuit that complements my curiosity for design and user experiences.
              <br>
              And of course, Iâ€™m an animal lover! Spending time with cats and dogs brings me peace and happiness, and I believe thereâ€™s something profoundly grounding about connecting with our furry companions.
              <br>
              Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m active on LinkedIn and would be more than happy to connect, collaborate, or assist in any way I can. Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow together! ðŸ˜Š</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
          <p><b>Docs, Project based learning using YouTube tutorials, Ugly Prototypes to learn debugging.</b></p>
					<p>I start by watching videos or reading documentation to grasp what a tech stack does and why itâ€™s used. Then, I follow expert tutorials, beginning with simple prototypes to understand the basics. Gradually, I tackle two more projects, each more complex, before confidently building my own unique project from scratch.</p>
